# Online Footprint App

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to create a prototype to the Linkedin Feature idea (described in the parent directory). Since this project is not at all affiliated with Linkedin, the prototype is being built out entirely separately. It is bare bones, first testing connecting to one's Github account and displaying data of their activity.
